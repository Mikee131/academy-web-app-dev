- [DHIS2 Academy Courses](https://academy.dhis2.org/courses): these courses are very helpful in understanding DHIS2 context in general (not only from development point of view) and we recommend them for anyone starting with DHIS2. They are also available in multiple languages (English, French and Spanish, and more to come soon)

- [Developer Portal](https://developers.dhis2.org)

- [App Platform documentation](https://developers.dhis2.org/docs/app-platform/getting-started)

- [UI library documentation](https://ui.dhis2.nu/)

    - [UI library demos (StoryBook)](https://ui.dhis2.nu/demo/)

- [**Using the API**](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/develop/using-the-api/dhis-core-version-240/introduction.html): there is extensive documentation for all aspects of the backend and the API.
    - For the context of this academy, we particularly recommend going through the first three sections of the [Metadata API](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/develop/using-the-api/dhis-core-version-240/metadata.html) as it covers many aspects of the REST API you'd need to deal with when developing web apps for DHIS2.
